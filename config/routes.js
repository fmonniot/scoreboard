 * Routes

/**
 * (1) Core middleware
 *
 * Middleware included with `app.use` is run first, before the router
 */


/**
 * (2) Static routes
 *
 * This object routes static URLs to handler functions--
 * In most cases, these functions are actions inside of your controllers.
 * For convenience, you can also connect routes directly to views or external URLs.

 * These routes can be disabled by setting (in `config/controllers.js`):

 *
 * All of your controllers ' actions are automatically bound to a route.  For example:
 *   + If you have a controller, `FooController`:
 *     + its action `bar` is accessible at `/foo/bar`
 *     + its action `index` is accessible at `/foo/index`, and also `/foo`

 * you can access CRUD operations for that model at:
 *		/foo/find/:id?	->	search lampshades using specified criteria or with id=:id
 *
 *		/foo/create		->	create a lampshade using specified values
 *
 *		/foo/update/:id	->	update the lampshade with id=:id
 *
 *		/foo/destroy/:id	->	delete lampshade with id=:id
